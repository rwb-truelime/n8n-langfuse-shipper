"""Public facade for n8n execution to Langfuse trace mapping.

This module provides the stable public API for converting n8n execution records
into Langfuse-compatible trace structures. All complex mapping logic is delegated
to the `mapping.orchestrator` module and its helpers in the `src/mapping/` package.

The facade pattern preserves backwards compatibility for existing imports while
allowing internal refactoring of the mapping implementation.

Public Functions:
    map_execution_to_langfuse: Convert n8n execution to LangfuseTrace
    map_execution_with_assets: Convert execution and collect binary assets

Internal Re-exports:
    _extract_model_and_metadata: Model extraction helper (test usage)
    _detect_gemini_empty_output_anomaly: Gemini bug detection (test usage)
    _flatten_runs: NodeRun chronological sorting (test usage)
    _resolve_parent: Parent span resolution (test usage)
    SPAN_NAMESPACE: Deterministic UUID namespace (test usage)

    Orchestrates the complete mapping pipeline: creates deterministic trace and span
    IDs, resolves parent-child relationships, normalizes I/O data, detects generation
    spans, and applies optional AI-only filtering.

    Args:
        record: n8n execution with workflow data and node run results
        truncate_limit: Maximum characters for input/output fields before truncation;
            0 disables truncation but binary stripping always applies regardless

            window (2 before, 2 after, and chain connectors); root span always included

        truncation is disabled. This ensures consistent output size constraints.

    Performs standard trace mapping while optionally collecting discovered binary/base64
